Module: data of 1 file in another file.


/*
app.use(express.static(dirPath));

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello from Express");
});

and if index.html is there then, server will render index.html file instead of "Hello from Express" because index.html is entry point. 
if we change the name of file to somethingelse.html , then it will render "Hello from Express".
